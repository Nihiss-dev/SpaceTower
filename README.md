# SpaceTower

## Description

This game was made in 48h during Pixel Challenge 2017 in Qu√©bec. The theme was "Challenge in limited space".

## Purpose

Each player begin the game with limited materials to build their tower. Multiple materials with different characteristics are available, they must choose wisely which one they will use, because as the time go away, the space where players can build is going to be smaller, and when time is up, each player will have to destroy other's tower. But they will use their remaining materials.
Players will have to manage how to build a good tower and how to destroy opponent's tower.

## Requirements

This game was made with Unity, so the all source are available here (don't judge code quality, everything was made in 48h). If you want to play, you will have to build the game in Unity 5.6.
The controls are made with controllers, keyboard is not supported, so to play, 2 controllers will be required. And obviously 2 players.

## Bugs

As the game was made in 48h, it's strongly possible that you will have some bugs (feel free to path it ! :) )
